# UMDB-udacity
Most of us can relate to kicking back on the couch and enjoying a movie with friends and family.
In this project, Iâ€™ve built an app to allow users to discover the most popular movies playing.
Ie will split the development of this app in two stages.
First, let's talk about stage 1.

## Popular Movies: Stage 1
Till this stage, the app can:
1) Present the user with a grid arrangement of movie posters upon launch.
2) Allow the user to change sort order via a setting:
      -> The sort order can be by most popular or by highest-rated.
3) Allow the user to tap on a movie poster and transition to a details screen with additional information such as:
-> original title
-> movie poster image thumbnail
-> A plot synopsis
-> user rating
-> release date
